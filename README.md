# Java NLP Toolkit
My personal Java NLP toolkit that serves as an interface to various existing NLP libraries.

This Java NLP Toolkit is designed to be used in the same way as [Stanford CoreNLP](http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/),
but with the ability to replace the components from other NLP packages, such as [OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/)
and [NLP4J](https://github.com/emorynlp/nlp4j).

Unlike [DKPro](https://dkpro.github.io/), which uses UIMA framework, this project uses Stanford CoreNLP simple APIs to
interface with your program. So we got the ease of use from Stanford CoreNLP and the performance from many NLP packages.
